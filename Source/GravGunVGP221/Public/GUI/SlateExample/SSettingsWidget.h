		Smart Pointers

		Unique Pointers: UnqiuePtr<T> = UniquePtr<int> score
			- Sole owner of the object
			- Cannot be copied, only moved
			- Automatically deletes the object when it goes out of scope
			- Eg. ScoreManager

		Shared Pointers: SharedPtr<T> = SharedPtr<int> PlayerHealth
			- Multiple ownership of the object it points to
			- Can be copied and shared among multiple owners
			- Automatically deletes the object when the last owner goes out of scope
			- Eg. UI widgets, game objects shared across multiple systems(Eg. Character health. UI might use it)

		Weak Pointers: WeakPtr<T> = WeakPtr<Enemy> EnemyTarget
			- Non-owning reference to an object managed by a shared pointer
			- Doesn't affect the reference count of the shared pointer
			- Can be used break ciricular references
			- Must be converted to a shared pointer before use
			- Eg. Targeting system, where you want to reference an enemy without preventing it from being destroyed

		Soft Object Pointers: SoftObjectPtr<T> = SoftObjectPtr<UStaticMesh> HugeCity
			- References an object that may not be loaded in memory
			- Load assets on demand, reducing memory usage and improving performance
			- Eg. Large open-world games, where you want to reference assets that may not be loaded yet
